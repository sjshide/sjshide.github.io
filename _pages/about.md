I'm a Research Staff Member at Institute for Defense Analyses. I'm working at the Missile Defense Agency.

Before that, I was a Data Scientist at NORAD/USNORTHCOM and a Data Scientist at [ModelOp](https://www.modelop.com/).

Prior to that, I did my math PhD at [UIC](https://mscs.uic.edu/), where I studied algebraic geometry and commutatitve algebra under [Kevin Tucker](https://kftucker.people.uic.edu/home/). My thesis was on Limit F-Signature functions. I also took a bunch of DS and ML classes in my last few years.

Before that, I was an undergrad at [Princeton](https://www.math.princeton.edu/), where I did my senior thesis with Kevin on similar stuff to my PhD.

Apart from that, I try to run a lot - here's [my Strava profile](https://www.strava.com/athletes/6930119). Since moving to Colorado, I've become interested in hiking, in particular 14ers and 13ers. Here's [my 14ers.com profile](https://www.14ers.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=96184). Current count is 33/58 14ers and 18 13ers (including unranked). I also enjoy doing the NY Times Crossword Puzzle (current streak 1862) and am trying to read more - here's [what I've been reading lately](https://sjshide.github.io/reading/).
