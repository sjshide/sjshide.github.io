I am a Data Scientist at [ModelOp](https://www.modelop.com/). Most of my work involves helping our clients with DS-type modeling. I also help support our main goal - getting ML models into production and in front of business users.

Prior to that, I did my math PhD at [UIC](https://mscs.uic.edu/), where I studied algebraic geometry and commutatitve algebra under [Kevin Tucker](https://kftucker.people.uic.edu/home/). My thesis was on Limit F-Signature functions. I also took a bunch of DS and ML classes in my last few years.

Before that, I was an undergrad at [Princeton](https://www.math.princeton.edu/), where I did my senior thesis with Kevin on similar stuff to my PhD.

Apart from that, I try to run a lot - here's [my Strava profile](https://www.strava.com/athletes/6930119). I also enjoy doing the NY Times Crossword Puzzle (current streak 396!) and am trying to read more - here's [what I've been reading lately](https://sjshide.github.io/reading/).
