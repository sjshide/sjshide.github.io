I'm a Research Staff Member at Institute for Defense Analyses.

Before that, I was a Data Scientist at NORAD/USNORTHCOM and a Data Scientist at [ModelOp](https://www.modelop.com/).

Prior to that, I did my math PhD at [UIC](https://mscs.uic.edu/), where I studied algebraic geometry and commutatitve algebra under [Kevin Tucker](https://kftucker.people.uic.edu/home/). My thesis was on Limit F-Signature functions. I also took a bunch of DS and ML classes in my last few years.

Before that, I was an undergrad at [Princeton](https://www.math.princeton.edu/), where I did my senior thesis with Kevin on similar stuff to my PhD.

Both my PhD and Undergrad theses have been incorporated into [F-Signature Functions of Diagonal Hypersurfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12863), joint with Kevin, [Alessio Caminata](https://alessiocaminata.wixsite.com/alca), and [Francesco Zerman](https://sites.google.com/view/francesco-zerman/home).

Apart from that, I try to run a lot - here's [my Strava profile](https://www.strava.com/athletes/6930119). Since moving to Colorado, I've become interested in hiking, in particular 14ers and 13ers. Here's [my 14ers.com profile](https://www.14ers.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=96184). Current count is 45/58 14ers and 39 13ers (including unranked/unnamed). I also enjoy doing the NY Times Crossword Puzzle (current streak 2590) and am trying to read more - here's [what I've been reading lately](https://sjshide.github.io/reading/).

Every December I enjoy doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I used to go for speed (2021: 147 global overall, 2020: 336 global overall); but now spend the month using AoC to remind myself how Python works since I work in Matlab these days. Some of my solutions are in my [AoC Repo](https://github.com/sjshide/AdventOfCode) - I have been hit or miss about cleaning up and posting over the years, and most years have at least a few where I do something very manual or using pencil and paper that I then don't spend the time to automate. My first "live" year was 2019, but now have 500 stars for 2015-2024.
